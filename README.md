BinarySearch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This will be my first attempt keeping a project up to date with Git.  
I am practicing with a binary search algorithm.
The language I am using is C++.
The BinarySearch will print "1" if the element is found and
"-1" if the element is not found.  The prompt was taken from 
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/who-will-win/0
This algorithm assumes a sorted list.  It was a quick project
so I did nothing to make sure that the list is sorted, but I did
make sure that the algorithm works with a sorted vector.
